# Task ID: 3
# Title: Enhance Recipe Import with Nutritional Data Matching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the recipe import system to automatically match ingredients with Frida nutritional data during the import process.
# Details:
1. Extend the current import function to include nutritional data matching
2. Implement a preprocessing step to standardize ingredient formats
3. Create a batch processing system for efficient matching
4. Develop a confidence scoring system for matches
5. Implement a manual review interface for low-confidence matches
6. Add nutritional data validation to ensure completeness
7. Create a reporting system for unmatched ingredients
8. Optimize the matching algorithm for performance with large imports
9. Implement caching to improve repeated imports
10. Add support for custom nutritional data entry

Technologies: Worker threads for batch processing, Redis or similar for caching, React Hook Form v7.x for manual review interface

# Test Strategy:
1. Test with various recipe formats (JSON, CSV, etc.)
2. Verify nutritional data accuracy after import
3. Benchmark import performance with large batches
4. Test the manual review process with edge cases
5. Validate the confidence scoring system
6. Create end-to-end tests for the entire import process

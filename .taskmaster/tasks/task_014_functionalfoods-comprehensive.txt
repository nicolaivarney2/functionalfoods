# Title: Implement Quality Control for AI-Generated Recipes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system to validate and ensure quality of AI-generated recipes before they are added to the database.
# Details:
1. Create a validation pipeline for generated recipes
2. Implement nutritional coherence checking
3. Develop ingredient-instruction consistency validation
4. Create cooking time and complexity estimation
5. Implement duplicate detection
6. Add manual review interface for flagged recipes
7. Create batch approval workflow

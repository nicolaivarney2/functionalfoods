# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Price Comparison Across Danish Supermarkets
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system to compare prices of ingredients across Danish supermarkets and optimize shopping lists for cost.
# Details:
1. Research and identify APIs for major Danish supermarkets (Netto, FÃ¸tex, Bilka, Rema 1000, etc.)
2. Implement API integrations for price fetching
3. Create a normalized product database for matching
4. Develop a price comparison algorithm
5. Implement store preference settings
6. Create visualization of potential savings
7. Add support for store-specific shopping lists
8. Implement caching for price data
9. Create scheduled updates for price changes
10. Add user feedback for price accuracy

Technologies: Node.js workers for API polling, PostgreSQL for price database, Redis for caching, React for interactive visualizations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test API integrations with each supermarket
2. Verify price comparison accuracy
3. Test caching and update mechanisms
4. Validate shopping list optimization
5. Benchmark performance with large shopping lists
6. Test error handling for API failures

# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Meal Plan Generation Algorithm
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an algorithm to generate personalized 6-week meal plans based on user profiles, dietary approaches, and nutritional requirements.
# Details:
1. Implement macro calculation service based on user profile data
2. Create a recipe filtering system based on dietary approaches
3. Develop a meal distribution algorithm for balanced weekly plans
4. Implement variety constraints to prevent repetition
5. Create nutritional balancing across days and weeks
6. Add support for user preferences and restrictions
7. Implement meal complexity distribution throughout the week
8. Add seasonal recipe weighting for relevant ingredients
9. Create fallback mechanisms for edge cases
10. Optimize algorithm performance for quick generation

Technologies: Linear programming with JavaScript-simplex or similar, Worker threads for background processing, Redis for caching generated plans

# Test Strategy:
1. Test algorithm with various user profiles
2. Verify nutritional balance in generated plans
3. Benchmark algorithm performance
4. Test edge cases like limited recipe availability
5. Validate meal variety and distribution
6. Create unit tests for individual algorithm components
